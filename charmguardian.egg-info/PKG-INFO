Description: # Charmguardian
        
        A testing tool for Juju charms, bundles, and charm/bundle merge proposals.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Clone repo and run `make` in the top-level directory.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Activate the virtualenv: `source .venv/bin/activate`
        
        Test a charm:
        
            CHARM_TEST_ENVS=local,amazon charmguardian lp:~charmers/charms/precise/ghost/trunk > output.json
        
        Test a bundle:
        
            BUNDLE_TEST_ENVS=local,amazon charmguardian lp:~bac/charms/bundles/charmworld-demo/bundle > output.json
        
        If `CHARM_TEST_ENVS` or `BUNDLE_TEST_ENVS` are not set, the `local`
        environment is used for all tests.
        
        ## Output
        
        See the `examples/` directory for sample output.
        
        ## Notes
        
        * When testing a charm, if the charm is included in any bundles, the
          tests for those bundles will be run also, using the version of the
          charm under test.
        * When testing a bundle, if multiple deployments are included in the
          bundle file, one is selected randomly and tests are run against that
          deployment. This may change or be configurable in the future.
        * Right now only bzr lp:-style urls are supported (see TODO)
        
        ## TODO
        
        There's still a lot to be done:
        
        * Add merge proposal testing.
        * Add Fetchers for more url and repo types, e.g. http, git, etc
        * Add support for testing at specific revisions (other than just HEAD)
        * Add tests
